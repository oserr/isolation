        Parameters
        ----------
        game : isolation.Board
            An instance of the Isolation game `Board` class representing the
            current game state

        depth : int
            Depth is an integer representing the maximum number of plies to
            search in the game tree before aborting

        alpha : float
            Alpha limits the lower bound of search on minimizing layers

        beta : float
            Beta limits the upper bound of search on maximizing layers

        maximizing_player : bool
            Flag indicating whether the current search depth corresponds to a
            maximizing layer (True) or a minimizing layer (False)

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The score for the current search branch

        tuple(int, int)
            The best move for the current branch; (-1, -1) for no legal moves

        Notes
        -----
            (1) You MUST use the `self.score()` method for board evaluation
                to pass the project unit tests; you cannot call any other
                evaluation function directly.
