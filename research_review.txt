AI techniques have allowed computers to surpass human performance in adversarial
games of perfect information, but minimax with alphabeta pruning and Monte Carlo
tree search have been unable to tame the complexity of the game of Go. In
Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search, the authors
present a new technique that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value networks
to evaluate positions and policy networks to select moves to defeat professional
human Go players.
